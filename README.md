# Databricks_ETL_TWstocks

### For Recuiters:
I recommend watching [this video] for a quick assessment of my abilities. The video is a review of this project.

## Inspiration:
This project is inspired by the idea of building a Databricks ETL pipeline for Taiwan stocks, aiming to explore quantitative trading strategies related to MVRH (Monthly Volume Record High). The design follows the Databricks multi-layer data lake architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold) and integrates Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 as the storage source.

## Navigation:
- The main part is in [advanced-dlt pipeline](./advanced-dlt pipeline), where I implemented a "Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline" (also known as "DLT") to complete this project.
- If you're new to Databricks, [basic-manual pipeline](./basic-manual pipeline) is a manual ETL pipeline where you might learn something from.
- Both of them are doing the same thing but different way.
- Add data visualization and automated reporting.
- Enhance data quality checks and anomaly detection.
